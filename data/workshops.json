      "The Girl Code organised the Summer of Code workshop series in June 2019.  The series comprised of three workshops, which were each two hours long, which was primarily focused on Python. It was held at Ideashub in United World College Southeast Asia, Dover in Singapore. The main objective was to teach Python to teenage girls from scratch. It was beneficial to the girls who had little to no prior knowledge in coding as this workshop served as a good platform to kickstart their interest and passion for coding. It was a meaningful and useful learning experience for the girls. This time we had a well-received response of approximately 60 attendees including mentors. We received positive feedback from those who attended the workshop which was a bonus."
